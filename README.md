# Optimizing Performance in Operating Systems

## Overview
This repository focuses on the study and application of performance optimization techniques within operating systems. It includes practical implementations and a detailed report outlining the strategies explored, their theoretical basis, results obtained, and insights garnered.

## Project Contents
- `Code`: Contains source code examples demonstrating various optimization techniques applied within an operating system context. These examples serve as practical illustrations of how theoretical concepts can be implemented to enhance system performance.
- `OS Project Report - pr2370.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, findings, and conclusions. This document offers in-depth insights into the optimization strategies studied and their impact on operating system performance.

## Getting Started
To explore this project:
1. Navigate to the `Code` directory to review the source code examples. Additional documentation within the directory will guide you through running and understanding the code.
2. Read the `OS Project Report - pr2370.pdf` for a thorough understanding of the optimization techniques explored, the rationale behind them, and the outcomes of their application.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from students, educators, researchers, and practitioners interested in operating system performance optimization. Whether you're adding new examples, enhancing the documentation, or providing feedback on the project report, your input is invaluable.
